# AAMLP_FinalPaper_Patten

This is a project for Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College class AAMLP. Because the data is private, a synthetic dataset has been updloaded to ensure the professor can run the code and make sure it works. Please note that you will need to change the name of the data to remove the sds ("synthetic data set") before this will run. 

The synthetic data is built off the result of the DataPrep file because it was too large to generate synthetic data before cleaning.
